# pmd_wan
read wan sprites, used in pokemon mystery dungeon: Explorers and Rescue Team (only tested with Explorers of Sky)

reading : production ready. Should never panic, and has been fuzzed

- m_attack.bin can sometimes errors

status of writing sprites : ugly, may work but may panic or produce incorrect result
- monster.bin and m_ground.bin should be both readable and writable
- probably all ground sprite should be too

creating an all new static sprite : Should work with no issue.
